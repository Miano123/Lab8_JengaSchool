Data Collections: Mini Project

We want to create a simple library management system. Let's call it LMS.
 
  Key things we want to handle:
     ❖ Borrowing
     ❖ Returning
     ❖ Inventory
A person should be able to borrow a book and the inventory should reflect
this. The same applies to returning.

For inventory, we want to have the title of the book and the count. The
library manager should be able to add more books to the inventory

Extra: We can track who is borrowing books using their ID number. So we
should be able to know who has what books.
